This is a project assigned to me in the course CS-61B. The majority of the code in Pixel.java, PixImage.java, RunIterator.java, Run.java, DList.java, DListNode.java, and RunLengthEncoding.java was written by me. The rest of it was supplied as a part of the project code.

Given an image, this module can convert it from an array of pixels to a run length encoding, blur the image, and perform Sobel edge detection on the image. It takes .TIFF images as input.

In order to blur an image, perform the following operation (after compiling the code):
java Blur "image".tiff #of times you want to blur

In order to perform Sobel edge detection on an image, perform the following operation (after compiling the code):
java Sobel "image".tiff #of times you want to blur
